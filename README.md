Things pertaining to playing rpg solo.

Usage of the scripts:
Assuming the snippets are in a file called NAME then `stanza NAME` randomly takes 5 snippets. `search TERM NAME` randomly takes 5 snippets containing TERM (as word or part of word). If an exact word is needed, for example man, use double quotes and spaces: `search " man " NAME`. This won't find `man` as first or last word of the snippet but I'll accept that for now.
